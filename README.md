## HAI - Heart Attack Indicators


=========================

### Executive Summary

This project aims to identify key indicators of heart attacks using survey data from the CDC's Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). By leveraging various data science techniques, including data loading, exploratory data analysis, pre-processing, and machine learning modeling, we strive to uncover meaningful insights that can inform public health strategies for cardiovascular disease prevention.
 
**Key Risk Factors in Heart Disease**

*Heart Attack Indicators*

Heart attacks or myocardial infarctions are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Understanding the indicators of a heart attack and risks associated with those factors is needed for early diagnosis, prevention and treatment. 

*Who is affected?*

There were 55.4 million deaths recorded in 2019 globally. 17.9 million died in 2019 from cardiovascular diseases 32% of global deaths and the number 1 reason for mortality in 2019. Since then, the instance of cardiovascular diseases has raised year on year by approximately 1.5 - 2 million on average from the recorded global data available. Which is due to several key indicators that have been researched and are known to increase the instance of cardiovascular disease. 

*Demographic Factors*

- Age: Higher ages are a risk factor, with higher incidence rates observed in older sexes. 

- Sex: Males generally have a higher risk of heart attacks compared to females, though post-menopausal women also face increased risk. 

*Medical History*

- Previous Cardiovascular Events: History of heart attack, angina, or stroke significantly increases the risk of subsequent heart attacks. 

- Chronic Conditions: Presence of conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and chronic kidney disease are strong indicators. 

- Family History: A family history of heart disease can increase an individual's risk. 

*Lifestyle Factors* 

- Smoking: Current and former smokers are at a higher risk compared to non-smokers. 

- Exercise: Lack of regular physical activity (minimum 1 hour daily) is associated with higher risk. 

- Diet: Poor dietary habits, including high intake of saturated fats and cholesterol, contribute to poor health at an increased rate of heart attacks. 

- Alcohol: Excessive alcohol consumption is a risk factor. 

*Psychological and Social Factors* 

- Stress and Depression: Chronic stress and depressive disorders are linked to increased risk of heart attacks. 

- Social: Factors such as socio-economic status, education, and access to healthcare can influence risk, as different areas have different lifestyle factors which contribute to a longer lifespan. 

*Biometric Indicators*

- BMI (Body Mass Index): Higher BMI is associated with increased risk of heart attacks. Though BMI has been disputed as an overall health measurement recently with research focused more on DEXA scans and waist to height measurements seeing more success. 

- Blood Pressure: Elevated blood pressure (hypertension) is a risk factor. 

- Cholesterol Levels: High levels of low-density lipoproteins (LDL) cholesterol and low levels of high-density lipoproteins (HDL) cholesterol are indicators of heart attacks. 

- Blood Sugar Levels: Elevated blood glucose levels are linked to increased risk, more so with patients with diabetes. 

 
**Mortality Preventative Measures**

*Cardiovascular Managment* 

Exercise, diet and social activity are but a few key areas to address if the instance of cardiovascular disease is a potential risk. Low cost and effective way of combating diseases. 

*Medicine*

Aspirin, beta blockers and ACE inhibitors are a few medications taken to combat heart disease though if you are taking them, you most likely already have a cardiovascular disease. In some countries medicine can be affordable but for most of the world, even the simplest of medicine remains out of reach.  This is almost always due to cost or country mismanagement. 

*Surgery*

If cardiovascular disease is advanced surgery may be the only option. Bypasses, ballons and transplants are few of the limited options of open-heart surgery. This is always a high risk, high cost and time consuming solution. It is good that the option for surgery is present but preferably not getting to this point would be the ideal situation. 


**Solution**

*Early Diagnosis*

Using data obtained by the CDC in America, creating a model or machine learning application that takes in a specific amount of known cardiovascular disease parameters and can predict if the user is at a high risk of a heart attack.  

*Impact of the solution*

Defining if someone is at a higher risk of cardiovascular disease / heart attacks is a data based, low cost, early diagnosis measure that can be implemented anywhere where there is an internet connection. It reduces the burden on healthcare institutions everywhere once implemented correctly. Knowing that if a patient comes into the clinic with this early diagnosis obtained through past data, the doctors will flag the patient and could then conduct further medical image analysis as soon as possible. For anyone wanting to know if they are at an increased risk, they do not have to book a doctor's appointment if they do not want to. Early diagnosis is the best way of preventing most diseases and in this instance, it is no different.  

 
**Dataset Description**

The Dataset (heart_attack_with_nans.csv) was obtained through Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kamilpytlak/personal-key-indicators-of-heart-disease/data) but was compiled by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in America, in 2022 (https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/annual_data/annual_2022.html). The CDC helps control the induction and spread of diseases. They also gain data on different diseases affecting the American population annually.  

As the CDC is a governmental institution the data obtained have gone through rigorous check before publication and even though mistakes can be made in the collection process, they are usually dealt with on a severity scale. The range is if the mistake is a minor one the CDC will use established data science techniques to rectify the problem or if the mistakes are severe the data will not be published. The dataset was collected though 17 minute telephone consultations in all 50 states. 40 Questions were asked, which represents the 40 columns present. This survey is conducted annually and in 2022 (the year of the dataset being used) there were 40 questions (40 columns) asked with 445,132 responses.
