Heart Attack Indicators Flowchart

1. Problem Definition

- Identify Problem: Identify the need for predicting heart attack risk to improve patient outcomes.
- Define Objectives: Goals could include early detection, reducing hospital readmission rates.
- Determine Success Criteria: Metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

2. Data Collection

- Source Data: Collect from the CDC, survey data.
- Data Accessibility: Ensure the data is properly formatted and accessible for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Understand Data Distribution: Visualize data distributions using histograms and box plots.
- Identify Patterns: Use scatter plots and pair plots to identify relationships between variables.
- Statistical Analysis: Perform correlation analysis to identify important features related to heart attack risk.

Data Preprocessing

- Data Cleaning: Handle missing values using imputation, remove duplicates, handle incorrect data.
- Data Transformation: Encode categorical features using one-hot encoding or label encoding.
- Preprocessing EDA: Look for colinearity and multicoliniarity in a datawide correlation matrix.

Feature Engineering

- Feature Selection: Select important features such as age, SmokerStatus, HadAngina.
- Feature Transformation: Apply transformations to improve model performance, e.g., log transformation of skewed data.

Model Selection

- Choose Algorithms: Consider algorithms like logistic regression, decision trees, random forests and KNN.
- Split Data: Divide data into training, validation, and test sets to evaluate model performance.

Model Training

- Train Model: Train chosen algorithms on the training dataset.
- Hyperparameter Tuning: Use Grid Search or Random Search to find the best hyperparameters.

Model Evaluation

- Key Metric: Establish a key metric. (Recall)
- Evaluate Performance: Use evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC to assess model performance.
- Cross-Validation: Perform cross-validation to ensure the model generalizes well to new data.
